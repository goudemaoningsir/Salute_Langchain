所有的`LLM`实现了`Runnable`接口，该接口附带了所有方法的默认实现，即`ainvoke`、`batch`、`abatch`、`stream`、`astream`。这为所有`LLM`提供了基本的流式传输支持。

流式传输支持默认返回一个Iterator（或在异步流式传输的情况下是AsyncIterator），这是底层`LLM`提供商返回的最终结果。这显然不提供逐个token的流式传输，这需要`LLM`提供商的原生支持，但确保了期望token迭代器的代码可以适用于我们所有的`LLM`集成。

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", temperature=0, max_tokens=512)
for chunk in llm.stream("Write me a song about sparkling water."):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

```
Verse 1:
Bubbles dancing in my glass
Clear and crisp, it's such a blast
Refreshing taste, it's like a dream
Sparkling water, you make me beam

Chorus:
Oh sparkling water, you're my delight
With every sip, you make me feel so right
You're like a party in my mouth
I can't get enough, I'm hooked no doubt

Verse 2:
No sugar, no calories, just pure bliss
You're the perfect drink, I must confess
From lemon to lime, so many flavors to choose
Sparkling water, you never fail to amuse

Chorus:
Oh sparkling water, you're my delight
With every sip, you make me feel so right
You're like a party in my mouth
I can't get enough, I'm hooked no doubt

Bridge:
Some may say you're just plain water
But to me, you're so much more
You bring a sparkle to my day
In every single way

Chorus:
Oh sparkling water, you're my delight
With every sip, you make me feel so right
You're like a party in my mouth
I can't get enough, I'm hooked no doubt

Outro:
So here's to you, my dear sparkling water
You'll always be my go-to drink forever
With your effervescence and refreshing taste
You'll always have a special place.
```
